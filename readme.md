# RFID keychain style pcb outline

**Description:** Empty KiCad project except the board outline/edge cuts for a pcb shaped like a standard RFID keychain tag. Preserved in case of reuse.

Standard RFID tag size, which is large enough for a coin cell holder.

:warning: Some fab houses may not be able to handle the inner oval cutout (replace with a round hole as needed)
